            <h2>What is Overclocking?</h2>
            <p>Overclocking is the process of making your computer's processor, GPU, or RAM run at a higher speed than it was originally intended to by the manufacturer. This can improve performance but comes with potential risks, such as system instability and overheating.</p>

            <h2>Is Overclocking Safe?</h2>
            <p>While overclocking can offer improved performance, it’s important to note that it can void warranties and, if done improperly, may result in permanent hardware damage. Always ensure your system has proper cooling and use safe settings recommended by experts.</p>

            <h2>General Steps for Overclocking</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure proper cooling solutions (air or liquid cooling).</li>
                <li>Access your system’s BIOS/UEFI.</li>
                <li>Gradually increase clock speeds and voltage settings.</li>
                <li>Monitor temperature and system stability during stress tests.</li>
                <li>Stay within safe temperature and voltage ranges to avoid hardware damage.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>These recommendations are based on tried and tested settings. However, overclocking is inherently risky, and you should proceed with caution. Neither this guide nor its authors are responsible for any damage to your components.</p>
